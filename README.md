# MinimalTabBar

A new, and elegant, solution to the TabBar on iOS. 
MinimalTabBar gets it's name by hiding once you have selected an item, leaving your UIViewControllers uncluttered.

## Gestures
While minimized the user has three seperate gestures to control navigation.

-- Tap
Opens the MinimalTabBar
-- Swipe
Slides the user between adjacent ViewControllers
-- Long Press
Gives the user a complete look at their app


Same functionality as the UITabBar with improved UX through gestures and UI transitions.
